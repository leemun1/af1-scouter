Why are Nike AF1s sold out everywhere??????

I can manually go check on Nike's or Footlocker's websites every now and then.

But that's so tedious.

There must be a better way to check if things are in stock, in the size i want.

hence introducing:

## AF1-scouter
A Python script that scrapes store websites to see if AF1 is available in my size.
