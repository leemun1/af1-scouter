Why are Nike AF1s sold out everywhere??????

It's so tedious to manually go check on Nike's or Footlocker's websites every now and then...

Hence introducing:
```
## AF1-scouter
A Python script that scrapes store websites to see if AF1 is available in my size.

### Example

### TODOs
- make into CLI
  - make `size`, `product`, `retry timeout` configurable
- setup `virtualenv`
- add usage instructions
- send notifications on discord?
